This is an encrypted instant messaging website created in 2021. Because it was created before I used github it is uploaded all in one commit. 

Features:
I used databases to store user infomation and messages. To ensure the security of the data I encrypted the messages in base64 and all passwords were hashed. Safeguarding was also a priority which is why you have to be at least thirteen to use the webiste, there is also an option to report users and a CEOP button. There is an option to change your profile picture and background to allow for users to express themselves. Furthermore the website is fully responsive to allow as many users as possible to be able to use the website.
